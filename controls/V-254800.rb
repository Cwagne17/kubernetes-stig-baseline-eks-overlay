Kubernetes (> v1.23)offers a built-in Pod Security admission controller to enforce the Pod Security Standards. Pod security restrictions are applied at the namespace level when pods are created. 

The Kubernetes Pod Security Standards define different isolation levels for Pods. These standards define how to restrict the behavior of pods in a clear, consistent fashion.'

Inspect the .yaml file defined by the --admission-control-config-file. Verify PodSecurity is properly configured.

Example File:
```yaml
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: AdmissionConfiguration
plugins:
- name: PodSecurity
  configuration:
    apiVersion: pod-security.admission.config.k8s.io/v1beta1

      # cluster components, because they need to run privileged containers
      usernames: ["admin"]
