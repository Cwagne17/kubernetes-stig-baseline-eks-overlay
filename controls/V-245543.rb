  it <<~JUSTIFICATION do
    is not a finding because the --token-auth-file flag
    is configured by the Kubernetes control plane managed by EKS.
    Amazon EKS uses webhook token authentication, service account tokens, and OIDC;
    customers cannot enable static token file authentication.
    See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/best-practices/identity-and-access-management.html
