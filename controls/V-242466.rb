      is not a finding because PKI certificate file permissions under /etc/kubernetes/pki
      are configured by the Kubernetes control plane managed by EKS.
      AWS is responsible for proper permissions on control plane PKI.
      See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/best-practices/control-plane.html
