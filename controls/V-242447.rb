  # TODO: Kube-proxy may be managed as an Amazon EKS add-on. If kube-proxy is an
  # EKS-managed add-on, this control should assert the add-on state via the AWS EKS API
  # (i.e., validate the add-on is present and configured per the control). If kube-proxy
  # is self-hosted on nodes (DaemonSet), this control should perform node-level checks
  # (e.g., locate the kube-proxy kubeconfig and validate ownership and permissions).
  # No executable logic implemented yet.
