  desc 'Protecting the audit data from change or deletion is important when an attack occurs. One way an attacker can cover their tracks is to change or delete audit records. This will either make the attack unnoticeable or make it more difficult to investigate how the attack took place and what changes were made. The audit data can be protected through audit log file protections and user authorization.

One way for an attacker to thwart these measures is to send the audit logs to another source and filter the audited results before sending them on to the original target. This can be done in Kubernetes through the configuration of dynamic audit webhooks through the DynamicAuditing flag.'

Review the feature-gates setting, if one is returned.

If the feature-gates setting is available and contains the DynamicAuditing flag set to "true", this is a finding.

On each Control Plane and Worker node, run the command:

If the "--feature-gates" option exists, this is a finding.

If any "--feature-gates" setting is available and contains the "DynamicAuditing" flag, remove the flag or set it to false.

On the each Control Plane and Worker Node, run the command:

Remove the "--feature-gates option" if present.

Edit the Kubernetes Kubelet config file: 
If the "featureGates" setting is present, remove the "DynamicAuditing" flag or set the flag to false.
